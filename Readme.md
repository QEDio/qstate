# Qstate

Qstate attempts to provide an easy way to keep all of your applications state information, basically the URL-Parameters, in one place.

It does so by providing different classes for different types of parameters (called plugins) like:

  * Date/DateTime
  * Rails parameters (action, controller)
  * Query parameters (database where parameters)
  * MapReduce parameters
  * Confidential parameters (user name, pub/priv key)
  * View parameters (similar to Rails, but not specific for rails)

QState will serialize/deserialize it's stored information as/from

  * String (URL)
  * Hash or
  * JSON

## Overview

The FilterModel (find a better name) is the organizing model. It knows about all configured plugins and creates dynamic
setters and getters for them.

Create a new FilterModel

    qstate = Qstate::Filtermodel.new

Add values

    qstate.view.add_value(:key, "value")
    qstate.view.add_value(:key1, "value1")
    qstate.query.add_value(:key2, :value2")

Now you serialize this information for example in URI format with:

    uri = qstate.uri

and you can then transform this URI back into a Filtermodel by doing

    qstate2 = Qstate::Filermodel.new(uri)

The parameters in the uri will be prefixed with a the following two characters:

  * Rails : '' (Rails parameters are not prefixed, so that those params can be used in rails and within qstate)
  * Date/DateTime: 't_'
  * View: 'v_'
  * Query: 'q_'
  * Confidential: '' (Confidential objects can not be serialized and have therefore no prefix)
  * MapReduce: 'm_'

## Extensibility

Qstate is designed around the principle that I don't know what you need. Therefore, Qstate can be configured in such a way
that only those you need, are available. Currently the complete codebase is loaded, but this will change in further releases as well.

If there is the need for a new plugin, it is easily written and integrated without having to interact with other plugins.
